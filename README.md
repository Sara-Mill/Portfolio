Sara Milligan's Profile Page--> 

This is a webpage I made to display my portfolio of work.

The page includes my name and a recent photo of me.

When the navigation links are clicked, the UI scrolls to the corresponding section on the page: About me, Examples of my work, and Contact information.

There are images of my applications, as well as placeholders of future projects.  When the images are clicked then user is taken to the deployed application.

When the user resizes the page or views from a mobile device, then are presented with a responsive layout that adapts to the viewport.
